ðŸ“Œ R Data Analysis | Practicing Data Import & Exploration
## This repository contains a basic dataset that I created to practice data import, 
exploration, and basic operations in R before working with real datasets. 
The dataset includes names, ages, genders, occupations, and income levels of 
individuals.
ðŸ“Œ Key Steps in This Project:
âœ” Imported the dataset from an Excel file using read_excel().
âœ” Checked the dataset structure with str().
âœ” Summarized key statistics using summary().
âœ” Checked for missing values using sum(is.na()).
âœ” Converted the dataset format from tbl_df to data.frame using as.data.frame().

ðŸ“Œ Purpose & Outcome:
## This project helped me develop a structured workflow for handling datasets in R.
By practicing data import, exploration, and transformation techniques, I gained 
confidence in working with structured datasets before moving on to complex
real-world data analysis.




# I made Gemini create an Excel Table because I wanted to practice by working data before starting to work with real dataset.
# I named the table as data9 and imported to R by using read_excel() function.
data9 <- read_excel("C:/Users/hp/Downloads/basitexcel.xlsx")
# I used head() function to see basic information about the dataset.
> head(data9)
